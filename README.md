# Raytracer in one weekend in Rust

## Why?
I need a raytracer for a computer vision project and have always heard about this class/course. 
I don't feel like writing more C++ at the moment, though I write C++ significantly better than Rust. 
Now I can learn more Rust and write up a Raytracer for a *coooool* Computer Vision + AI project.
The Rust code isn't great but just needs to work for the moment and teach me a few concepts. 

## Build
`git clone ...`

`cargo build`

`./target/debug/rt > image.ppm`
